                <h4>
                    Football is a game of momentum, a game that takes a larger overall effort to accomplish something. Instead of, say, basketball, where someone scores every 20 or so seconds, it takes a successful effort over time from the entire team to score or prevent the other team from doing so.

                    Another special part about soccer that makes it unique is that it is a simple game that requires neither many players nor any equipment besides a ball. Those who have played from a young age can tell you about the countless games that used rags as a ball and trees or shoes as a goal. Those were the best games because even if your team was getting absolutely destroyed in the game, you could always find a way to win when it was last goal wins.

            </h1>
            <p>
                One factor contributing to football's popularity is its accessibility. Compared to other sports, football is relatively simple to learn and play. It's also relatively inexpensive, with basic equipment such as a football and a pair of cleats being relatively easy to come by. Additionally, football can be played in a variety of settings, including a backyard, a park, or a full-size field. This allows people of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels to participate.
